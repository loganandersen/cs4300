I used copilot as a form of better search. I asked copilot questions about my .bashrc and how to a folder to my executable path. 
I asked it how where I can get the default bashrc. I found out that you can get the default bashrc from 
/etc/skel/.bashrc. I forgot what the name of $PATH, so I asked it what variable should I edit to add a folder
to my executable search path in bash and it reminded me. I did this because I wanted a folder called ~/bin that 
I could write commands in (such as run_server, which calls the python command to run the server).\

I asked copilot to "summarize django duration field" so that I could get a summary of what it is.  

I asked copilot to give me a list of booking statuses for a movie 
app because I wasn't sure what sort of statuses showed up on a 
booking system. 

I asked copilot why serializers are needed for HTML rest 
framework and it explained that it turned models into json.

I asked copilot what permission_classes was for view and 
I think I just need AllowAny because I don't have any users.
