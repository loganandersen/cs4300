## AI usage
I used copilot as a form of better search. I asked copilot questions about my .bashrc and how to a folder to my executable path. 
I asked it how where I can get the default bashrc. I found out that you can get the default bashrc from 
/etc/skel/.bashrc. I forgot what the name of $PATH, so I asked it what variable should I edit to add a folder
to my executable search path in bash and it reminded me. I did this because I wanted a folder called ~/bin that 
I could write commands in (such as run_server, which calls the python command to run the server).
